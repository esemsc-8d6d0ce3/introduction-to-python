    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in [lecture 4](..\\lecture4\\lecture4.ipynb), Python classes combine a storing data (attributes) and functions (methods) that process that data. They act as a way to create new data types. In the previous lecture, we learned some of the individual features of classes. In this section we will learn to put multiple features together to implement and improve a class based on the functionality we need it to provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1: Quaternions\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as complex numbers extend the set of real numbers into a \"two-dimensional\" space, [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) extend the concept of \"2D\" complex numbers into a \"four-dimensional\" space. Quaternions are used in computer graphics, control theory, signal processing, and orbital mechanics, and more generally in areas involving applying multiple rotations or scalings using floating point arthimetic. In the realm of science, they are also used in physics to describe the quantum spin of a particle. We are going to briefly describe the mathematical properties of quaternions as numbers and then you will work to implement a class to represent them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A quarterions is an object (viewed as a single number) consisting four real coefficients, say $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, along with rules for addition, mutilplication by a scalar, and multiplication by another quaternion. The rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addition: \n",
    "  $$(a, b, c, d) + (e, f, g, h) = (a+e, b+f, c+g, d+h)$$\n",
    "2. Multiplication by a scalar:\n",
    "  $$r(a, b, c, d) = (ra, rb, rc, rd)$$\n",
    "3. Multiplication by another quaternion: \n",
    "  $$(a, b, c, d)(e, f, g, h) = (ae - bf - cg - dh, af + be + ch - dg, ag - bh + ce + df, ah + bg - cf + de)$$\n",
    "These rules are enough to define the quaternions as a number system, as well as a [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) over the real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a complex number can be written in the form $a + bi$ (or in Python in a form like `1+2j`), a quaternion can be written in the form $a + bi + cj + dk$. This means they keep both engineers and mathematicians happy by having `i` & `j` both denote complex components of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the rules of multiplication above we have:\n",
    "$$ i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1, $$\n",
    "$$ ij = k, \\quad jk = i, \\quad ki = j. $$\n",
    "In this sense, we can think of the $i$, $j$ and $k$ as three separate complex dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Quaternions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is enough information to start implementing a class to represent quaternions. We'll do this in a single cell immediately below. As you work through this section, we'll add more features to the class, and need to re-run the cell to update the class definition. If anything doesn't work or your results get confusing, try restarting the Python kernel and re-running that cell to see it it cleans up the problem.\n",

The \"best\" way to do this in Python is to define a new \"abstract\" class called `Polygon` that implements reusable methods for generic shapes (where possible) in terms of the Points or edges of the polygon, and then define a new class for each shape that inherits from `Polygon` as a base class and which implements the methods that are specific to that shape (for example the `area` method for a triangle is different to the `area` method for a square).\n",

    "\n",
    "Build a class to represent the data provided from a [weather station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_station). The station has the following fixed data attached to it:\n",
    "- A name (a string)\n",
    "- A location (a tuple of two floats, representing the latitude and longitude)\n",
    "- A height above sea level (a float, representing the height in meters)\n",
    "\n",
    "The station also has (at a minimum) the following data that change over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A temperature (a float, representing the temperature in degrees Celsius)\n",
    "- A humidity (a float, representing the humidity as a percentage)\n",
    "- The pressure (a float, representing the pressure in hPa)\n",
    "\n",
    "The class should have methods to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An initialisation method (`__init__`) that takes the name, location, and height above sea level as arguments, and stores them, as well as doing some initialisation of the temperature, humidity and pressure (plus other variables if you've added them).\n",
    "- A method to update the temperature, humidity, and pressure.\n",
    "- Appropriately implemented `__str__` and `__repr__` methods.\n",
    "- Methods to calculate appropriate \"weather\" metrics, such as the [dew point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point) (it's ok to use the simplified formula), the [heat index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index), and so on, and to convert between different temperature scales (e.g. Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin). You may want to make use of the `@property` decorator to make these methods feel like attributes to the user."
